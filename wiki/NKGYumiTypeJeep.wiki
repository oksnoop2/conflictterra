== Role ==

||[http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/games/CT/unitpics/baabuggy.png]||Mobile anti-air jeep that fires two homing missiles.||

Speedy and lightly armored, the Yumi Type Jeep excels at both shooting down aircraft that stray into its airspace, and chasing down any fleeing aircraft.  This unit fires two homing Anti-Air missiles that does the same amount of damage to aircraft as it does cruisers.  Despite this, it is more effective against aircraft due to the large HP values that most cruisers have.

Due to their usefulness, it is usually a good idea to invest in at least a handful of these units.  It should be remembered that they are quite a bit speedier than other tanks, and will usually be the first to the front line in a group move.  A way to prevent this is to utilize a function in the game.

By holding CTRL while initiating a group move, all units will move at the same speed as the slowest unit selected.  This can help keep the Yumi Type Jeep back behind or around units that can attack the ground.

== History ==
The Yumi Type Jeep had its beginning as another unit actually.  The original blueprint for the NKG army had no anti-air unit on the ground other than turrets; the only way to shoot at aircraft with a mobile unit was to build fighters.  This design of course had a flaw because it meant players were required to invest in a whole other line of units just for defense against an especially versatile type of unit, the aircraft.

It was suggested often to create a land-based anti-air unit, and I eventually caved in and provided that.  Oksnoop2 began the process by changing the weapon of the now scraped [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGTatakauTypeTank Tatakau Type Tank] to an anti-air missile.  This impromptu experiment of course yielded great results, allowing players to finally be able to defend against the air from the ground with ease.  The [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGTatakauTypeTank Tatakau Type Tank] remained as the Anti-Air Tank for a brief period of time, before I finally modeled a dedicated unit.

When I finally started trying to drum up ideas for an Anti-Air Tank, I soon came to the realization I didn't want an actual tank-like vehicle.  Brainstorming alternatives, I eventually decided on a sort of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humvee humvee] type vehicle.  Replicating that style of vehicle was actually a bit of a challenge, and what I came up with is actually slightly odd if you look closely.  But it works at most play-levels.

The missile turret is perhaps the best part of model.  This is around the time I stopped using dots on the texture to signify missile launchers, and instead moved to more realistic and better looking alternatives of opening doors and hatches.  It is near impossible to notice from an average play level of zoom, but the Yumi does have small hatches that open when it fires.

== Name ==
Yumi is the Japanese word for "bow", such as a bow and arrow.  The name was given to the "baabuggy" with the loosely coherent idea that the unit would be shooting units out of the sky like an archer.
