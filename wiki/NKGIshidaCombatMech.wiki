== Role ==

||[http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/games/CT/unitpics/bsiegemech.png]||Medium SM designed to take out enemy structures.  Armed with a heavy gun and two rapid fire cannons.||

The Ishida Combat Mech is a heavier armed and armored mech whose primary purpose is to destroy enemy buildings.  While its main gun has a shorter range than the Uma Type Hover Truck artillery, it fires more quickly, and the Ishida Combat Mech is also armed with secondary Rapid Fire Cannons, much like the Hojo Combat Mech.  This allows the Ishida Combat Mech to be able defend itself to a reasonable degree.  This culminates in a formidable opponent, which can deal heavy damage if used in small groups and protected from anti-mech units.  Its power comes at the price of being more expensive to build than other mechs, but they are almost always worth building.

== History ==
Created about halfway through the NKG's initial development process, this unit went through a handful of revisions prior to texturing.  I wanted it to be a humanoid bipedal mech, but I also wanted it to have only one gun.  I tried putting the gun in its chest, on one arm, and finally settled on its back.  I was somewhat unsure of this at first, but decided I had no better ideas.  It gives the unit a slightly strange appearance, with the upright cannon looking like a smokestack to some kind of steam-driven machine.  At times it also makes me think of Abe Lincoln and his famous stovepipe hat.

When I placed the main gun, however, I realized that with my maxim of having no humanoid hands, this mech had no reason to have arms.  An armless bipedal mech would indeed look very strange, and so I was unsure what to do.  I soon decided to give him machine gun "hands", much like the Hojo Combat Mech.  This additional armament was not initially planned, but has proved to be a useful and interesting improvisation.

The overall look of the unit was meant to be like a beefier Hojo Combat Mech.  I once again drew upon [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armored_core Armored Core] for inspiration.  The shape of the shoulders were taken from a pair of heavy Arms in the original Armored Core, and the legs were also partially derived from a set of heavy Legs in this game.

It is one of the few units that does not completely aim when it fires!  Due to the odd placement of the gun on its back, I encountered difficulty making it aim properly on the X axis.  Although I now know how to remedy this, I didn't at the time, and resolved to have the gun always move to the same angle when firing.  This looks rather fine most of the time, especially at the typical zoom level while playing a game.  Only when zooming in very closely to the unit, and while firing at high or low enemies, does it look oddly.

This unit also originally came with the High-Trajectory option provided by Spring.  It was, afterall, an artillery unit.  However, during one game I realized that when this was turned on, it affected all of the weapons.  The Rapid Fire Cannons also shot straight up!  This of course looked very odd, especially when considering that due to the range limits, the bullets phased out of existence a few hundred feet above the unit.  There was no way around this, other than taking away the High Trajectory ability.

Although it shares the exact same walking animation as the Hojo Combat Mech, its considered to look better on this Ishida.  I think the best explanation is just that its bulky appearance, and perhaps the length of its limbs, lends itself well to what I cobbled together as a walk animation.

== Name ==
The Ishida is an example of me giving a name I don't like to a unit I do like.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishida_Mitsunari Ishida Mitsunari] was a samurai whose name in Japanese history is indeed an important one.  The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sekigahara Battle of Sekigahara], in 1600, which was to determine the fate of Japan for the next 200 years, was fought between himself and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_Ieyasu Tokugawa Ieyasu].  It was Ishida Mitsunari who rallied under the cause of maintaining the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyotomi_Hideyoshi Toyotomi] name, which had united Japan only a handful of years earlier.  However, he lost the battle due to key generals betraying his cause and joining the Tokugawa, who would go on to establish the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_shogunate bakufu] that ruled Japan until the coming of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_Restoration West in 1868].  Perhaps due to the fact that he lost, Ishida Mitsunari is often depicted as being unsavory and difficult-to-like, and it is for this reason that I dislike his name.

It was picked due the waning choices of samurai and daimyo names, and also for the fact that while I don't like the Ishida, they were an important and powerful player in the fate of medieval Japan.
