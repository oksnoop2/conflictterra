= Note for Players =

While Conflict Terra will try to make any non-CT map playable by spawning mine-able resources according to the metal map, this does not always give the best results. 
So for the best experience you should play an [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/MapInfo#"Official"_Conflict_Terra_Maps official map], prefixed with CT.

We also have a growing list of non-CT maps by the community that have configuration files which allow them to have unique resource layouts.  A list of these maps can be found [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/MapInfo#Non-CT_Maps_with_Defined_Resource_Placement here].  

= Conflict Terra Map Policy =

We decided that our policy towards community maps for the game is that if you put the proper lua in the map, and put "CT" at the beginning of the map name, we're okay with what you make.  You can go with whatever visual style you want, that is up to you.  The development team will continue to make maps in the style you've seen.

Here are some links to some guides to help you make your own Conflict Terra map, if you'd wish to do so.

= Non-CT Maps with Defined Resource Placement =
Besides placing resources via the metal map, Conflict Terra also contains configuration files for more detailed placement of resources.

So far Conflict Terra includes configuration files for the following Spring maps:

  * KochCanyon-v02
  * MoonQ20x
  * Terra
  * TitanDuel
  * Trench_Linked
  * Valley Of Unrest V3
  * Victoria Crater
  * Seths_Ravine
  * Tabula v4

Thanks to all mappers who originally made these nice maps :)
