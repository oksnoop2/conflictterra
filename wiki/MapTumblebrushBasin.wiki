== Description ==
CT Tumblebrush Basin is a large basin where fighting quickly ignites.  The flat bottom of the basin appears barren at first, but it is actually filled with cacti, flowering barrel cacti, and tumbleweed.  Large, weathered hoodoo stand in small clumps in the basin, guarding some of the larger, monolithic hoodoo that have formed for centuries.  Some say a strange plant grows high in the hills there, a hybrid plant called tumblebrush!

== Tactics ==
Victory has come time and time again to the most aggressive player on this map.  Players who take the middle of the map soon have access to a wealth of resources, and are more likely to control resources that drop on the map.  Setting up guarded mining areas is crucial on this map.

  * Tanks can climb most of the lower slopes on this map.
  * Mechs can climb most slopes on this map.

The south generally has easier to defend bases than the north, although the north is arguably able to more easily claim the middle land.  Players who start on the sides will have the hardest time due to the potential for attacks on both sides.

Some players may find it beneficial to hide economic buildings in the depressions that lay around the outside of the map.

== History ==
CT Tumblebrush Basin was a map made-on-the-fly, and quickly pushed out to play-testing.  What we found was that Tumblebrush was actually very fun to play on, and felt both organic and balanced.  The flowering cacti features were made specifically for this map, along with the tumbleweed features.

The name comes from an interesting and somewhat confusing goof up.  For no reason other than ignorance, the first tumbleweed feature was given a sage colored texture, indeed to simulate sagebrush.  It didn't look right, and some research divined that tumbleweed and sagebrush are actually completely different plants!  A proper tumbleweed was immediately made, but we decided playing with this mistake could add some fun, so we placed the newly dubbed tumblebrush in the highlands.

It was also the first map to feature hoodoos.  Fascinating rock formations, we felt they would be an important part of our desert theme.  Originally the map only sported the smaller hoodoo clumps, but we eventually made larger, solo hoodoos to add some more height to the map.
