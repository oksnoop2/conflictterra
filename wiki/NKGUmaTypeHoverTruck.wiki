== Role ==

||[http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/games/CT/unitpics/bartillery.png]||Light mobile artillery.  Stronger against buildings than units.||

The Uma Type Hover Truck is a long ranged artillery unit, capable of dealing high damage to buildings over great distance.  They also deal adequate damage to units, but due to their long reload rate and low HP, they should never be on the front line.  It should be noted that the Uma Type Hover Truck out-ranges the [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGIshidaCombatMech Ishida Combat Mech] and also deals more damage per shot, but fires more slowly.

The Uma Type Hover Truck is, obviously, a hover unit, which means it can travel over water and land seamlessly.

The Uma Type Hover Truck also has the High-Trajectory mode.  When this is activated, the unit will fire at a very steep trajectory in order to clear any obstructions that may be in front of the unit.  It should be noted that it takes the projectiles a much longer time to reach the target this way, but sometimes it is necessary.

Being the most expensive Tech Level 1 tank, they are nonetheless usually a safe investment, especially when trying to crack a dug-in player.

== Story ==
Coming soon!

== History ==
Like the [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGKumaTypeTank Kuma Type Tank], there is not much to say about this unit.  Modeled early, the Uma is a fairly straightforward unit.  It was given the appearance of a truck to help differentiate it from the other tanks.

The mounting for the gun is somewhat odd and could look better.  It was the first unit that I began experimenting with the boundaries of animation, poking out beyond the play-pen of the animation script provided to us.  The gun rotates both on the x and y axis, an example of this experimentation.

The decision to make it a hover unit was, like most of the hover units, an arbitrary one.  The consequences of having a sea-worthy artillery unit has always somewhat bothered me, but it has not caused too many headaches yet.

== Name ==
Uma is the Japanese word for "horse".  The name was given for little reason, although one could perhaps view the horse as a vital aspect of ancient warfare, mirroring the usefulness of modern-day artillery.  It would be an abstract correlation though.
