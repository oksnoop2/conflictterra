= Your Flagship =

Your *Oda Class Cruiser* is your *Flagship*, or *Commander* for those coming from a Total Annihilation background.  While the game won't end if it is killed under normal circumstances, the *Flagship* can be powerful early on and is critical to starting the building of your base.  The *Flagship* is unique though in that it does not directly build anything.  The *Flagship* must morph into the *Mobile Headquarters* in order to build any units.

It should be noted that the *Flagship* can also morph into the *Owari Class Cruiser*, or *Battle Flagship*.  The *Battle Flagship* is a one-way morph, in that you cannot return to the normal *Flagship*, and therefore you cannot morph into the *Mobile Headquarters*.  The *Battle Flagship* is a powerful cruiser, armed with several lasers and one powerful laser that can destroy any unit in one hit.  The cost to morph into this unit is very high, however, so it should only be done later in the game when your economy can support it.

= The Mobile Headquarters =

The *Mobile Headquarters* is an armed factory, able to both produce units and fire on the enemy.  The *Mobile Headquarters* is where you start building your base.  Able to build the *Engineer Support Mech*, the three factory cruisers, and the *Resurrection Truck*, the *Mobile Headquarters* is also a resource drop off point for your miners.

  * == The Engineer Support Mech ==
  The *Engineer Support Mech* fulfills two roles.  It is able to build buildings such as power plants, *Resource Drop Zones*, and various turrets.  It also mines metal from fallen meteorites.  This is the main way to gather metal in Conflict Terra.

  [http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/Engineer's%20roles.png]

  The stance that your miners are on is important and understanding what these stances do will let you have tighter control over your miners.
    * *Hold Position* - Will not search for meteorites to mine at all.  If you want to build a building, you'll more than likely need your *Engineer Support Mech* on Hold Position.
    * *Maneuver* - Will search for meteorites to mine within a short distance, but will not seek out meteorites that are far away.
    * *Roam* - Will search for meteorites to mine within any distance.

  The *Engineer Support Mech* will have to take it's metal back to a drop off point in order for the metal to be usable.  There are two drop off points:  the *Mobile Headquarters*, and the *Resource Drop Zone*.  These buildings have a white ring around them, indicating they are drop off points.

  A miner carrying metal will have a yellow triangle around it.

  A meteorite being mined by a miner will have a green circle around it.

  * == Factory Cruisers ==
  The *Mobile Headquarters* is able to build three different factory cruisers.  These are the *Saito Class Cruiser*, the *Takeda Class Cruiser*, and the *Heike Class Cruiser*.  Each of these cruisers are able to deploy into a distinct factory, able to produce either mechs, tanks, or aircraft, respectively.

  [http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/Cruisers.png]

  The deployed factory cruisers are able to pack back up into a cruiser form to move.  Knowing when and where to deploy and pack up your cruisers will be important in a game of Conflict Terra!  Each of these cruisers are also able to upgrade into a Tech Level 2 version, which can themselves deploy into a factory to produce Tech Level 2 units of their type.

  [http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/Beacon.png]

  The *Mobile Headquarters* can build all three of these initial cruisers, but in the event your *Flagship* or *Mobile Headquarters* is lost, you can build more cruisers through the *Cruiser Beacon*, built by the *Engineer Support Mech*.

  * == Resurrection Truck ==
  The *Resurrection Truck* is a utility vehicle, able to repair damaged units, reclaim resources laying on the map such as wreckages or trees, and even resurrect fallen units from their wreckage.

= Meteors and Meteorites =

At the beginning of a game, you'll find already-fallen meteorites across the map that you can begin mining from the start.  These will dry up quickly, however, and before long you'll have to rely on fresh resources.  Every two minutes of game time, a meteor storm will drop meteorites on a point on the map.  These fresh resources will of course be hot spots for conflict.

[http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/Meteors.png]

Fortunately, the *Resource Drop Zone* can be morphed into a mobile form to fly to new meteorite impact zones.  It should be noted the *Resource Drop Zone* is only a resource drop off point when it is deployed as a building.

= Energy =

In addition to metal mined from meteorites, you'll need Energy to build new units and buildings.  Energy can be generated from power plants, built by the *Engineer Support Mech*.  These power plants will also be high priority targets for good players, so protect them well!

= Taking to the Field =

Creating military units is of course very important to winning in Conflict Terra.  This is the case even more so because you will want to defend any meteorites that land in your territory, or you may want to attack a nearby cluster in order to claim them for yourself.  Conflict Terra groups its military units into 6 important groups.  These are:
  * *Mechs*
  * *Tanks*
  * *Aircraft*
  * *Ships*
  * *Submarines*
  * *Cruisers*
This is important because these are the 6 armor groups, explained [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/ArmorSystem here].  Some units deal especially high damage to special groups, such as the *Kuma Type Anti-Mech Tank*.  Remembering these strengths and weaknesses will be crucial to you winning, and losing, against others.

While there are of course differences between all of the units, in general these apply:
  * *Mechs* have less HP, shoot and move faster, and deal more damage than tanks.  They are also generally more expensive and take more time to build than tanks.  Some even have special abilities.
  * *Tanks* have more HP, shoot and move more slowly, and deal less damage thank mechs.  They also are generally cheaper and build more quickly than mechs.
Picking what kind of units you want to build first is an important decision, and trying to cover all of your bases will be crucial to your success.
