= The Drone Faction =

== Caution: This page is still under construction information may not be accurate. ==

     The Drones are a simple faction with several units that can clone themselves to create a massive army capable of destruction on a broad scale. Little is known about their origins other than that they are a robot-like alien civilization attacking earth in search of metal. They must harvest earth and destroy all in their way to continue their existence.

==*Drone Economy*==

The Drone economy is slightly different from the NKG's. They still mine meteors and create energy, but their way of going about it is different. The Drones main unit, the Drone Engineer, finds some meteorites to mine, then morphs into the Drone Mining Tower. This tower then extracts metal from the meteor using a thin, constant laser beam. The tower is a stable building when in the tower state. Once the meteors are depleted, simply morph the engineer back and continue your adventure!
