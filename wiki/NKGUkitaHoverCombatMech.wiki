== Role ==

||[http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/games/CT/unitpics/bhovermech.png]||Hover-equipped "mech" that is able to instantly move between land and sea.  Armed with both missiles and torpedoes.||

The Ukita Hover Combat Mech is a unique unit.  It is a hover unit, meaning it can move between land and sea seamlessly, and therefore is armed to deal with both situations.  Able to fire two missiles to attack land units, and two torpedoes to damage floating and submerged units, the Ukita Hover Combat Mech would be a jack-of-all-trades if it could attack flying units, which it can't.  Due to their versatility they are somewhat expensive, and don't specialize in damaging any armor class.  They excel on maps with water.

== History ==
This unit has had a long and sad history, changing form, role, and even name until it finally became what it is today.  It started off as an amphibious mech in concept, the plan being that while in the water it would be in a slightly submerged and speedy "mode", and when it reached land, it would change form slightly and walk slowly.

||The submerged "water" mode of the original model.||

I modeled a mech that I actually rather liked.  It resembled a shark, and reminded me of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Wing_mobile_units#OZ-08MMS_Cancer Cancer Mobile Suit] from Gundam Wing.  The concept of how it was to function also came from the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Mobile_Suit_Gundam_mobile_weapons#Z.27Gok Z'Gok] of Mobile Suit Gundam.

||The upright, walking "land" mode of the original model.||

I went ahead with developing this unit all the way into getting it in-game.  However, when I went to animate it, I realized that I did not know how to make it actually _do_ what I wanted it to.  There was no easy way to make a unit appear submerged in the water, and then while on land, alter itself and walk upright.  So I put the unit away, and ignored the notion of an amphibious mech for a long time.

This original idea was also at odds with the original structure I outlined for the NKG, and what was possible, and indeed, what it would become.  Originally, there was to be a sort of floating "cruiser", a large boat that built submarines and the amphibious mechs.  This was of course inspired by the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Mobile_Suit_Gundam_mobile_weapons#Gradro Gradro], once again from Mobile Suit Gundam.  With this idea disabled for a long stretch of time, I had to resort to "normal" factories, and with them came a more stereotypical "amphibious" mech.

Like the [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGUedaCombatSupportMech Ueda Combat Support Mech], the unit that we see today as the Ukita Hover Combat Mech was modeled shortly before the initial playtesting began.  I asked a friend which he thought would be a cooler unit:  a hover mech, or a mech that walked on the seafloor.  Both would give me my amphibious quality, and both were easy to do.  He told me he preferred a hover unit, and so I set out to model something that hovered.

||An early sketch of the odd vehicle.||

My thinking at the time of modeling this unit was admittedly a bit odd, but I figured that some kind of "hover" technology could provide the floating quality, and I wanted some other way for actual propulsion.  What I came up with were strange corkscrew "legs" that could propel it both in the water and on land.

||What I came up with is not unlike this odd vehicle.||

The body I attached to these legs was a generic and very boxy form, equipped with missile pod arms and torpedo tube cut-outs in the "hull."

For the longest time this unit was internally known as the "bamphmech" and externally as the Amphibious Mech.  To this day it makes sense to me, as it is indeed amphibious.  However, the fact that it is actually a hover unit confused and upset others to the point that one day I changed its internal name to "bhovermech" and its external name to match it.

For a period of time, this unit was only built from the [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGSubmarinePens Submarine Pens].  It saw limited use, so I decided it made sense to put it in the [http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGMechFactory Mech Factory].  With easy accessibility, it became known that it was very cheap, and effective for its cost.  Indeed, at this time it could attack flying units, and so it was a jack-of-all-trades.  Players could effectively spam these units early on and decimate an unsuspecting foe.  Balance was soon in order, and today we rarely see the Ukita Hover Combat Mech due to Conflict Terra's (hopefully) temporary incompatibility with water maps.

== Name ==
Being a late comer, Ukita was given as this unit's name as a true bottom-of-the-barrel name.  It comes from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukita_Hideie Ukita Hideie], a somewhat minor name in the Sengoku Jidai of Japan.  An advisor of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideyoshi Toyotomi Hideyoshi], the Uniter of Japan, he fought at the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sekigahara Battle of Sekigahara] and was exiled later for being on the losing side.  His family name always stuck out to me, but nothing more.
