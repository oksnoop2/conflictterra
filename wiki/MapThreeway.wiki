== Description ==
A forested oasis in a desert mountain range, CT Threeway is the perfect secluded battleground.  Unusually symmetrical ranges divide three meadows, with a dense forest standing in the middle.  A steep cliff rings the map, providing an alternative route to most positions on the map.

----

== Tactics ==
Intended to fulfill the odd role of a three person Free For All, the map will result in one winner and two bitter losers.  The top two positions have more area to defend, which can result in more room to expand, while the bottom position has less land to build in, resulting in an easier to defend position.

  * Tanks can climb to the cliffs that ring the map.

There are only three paths to the ring of cliffs, each pass being accessible in each section of the map.

Aggressive players will more than likely succeed here, as there are constantly two or three fronts to defend.  A difficult map to play on, it is one of the more intense of Conflict Terra's maps.

----

== History ==
Made to meet the requirement of a 1v1v1 map, the design is simple and the color scheme familiar.
