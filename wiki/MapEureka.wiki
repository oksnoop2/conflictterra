== Description ==
CT Eureka is a relatively open map that is broken up by small hills.  Pine trees grow in bunches around the foot of the hills, the last remnants of the forest that covered the lowland.  In the distance, aged and worn mountains surrounded by a humid mist hem in this high-altitude plain.

== Tactics ==
Movement along the edges of the map is easy due to the lack of hills, which means that players can easily expand.  This of course means that enemy players can expand into you as well!  Moving into the middle can provide tactical advantages due to the hills.

  * Tanks cannot climb the hills.
  * Mechs can climb the hills.

The hills are good places to build radar towers, but are also susceptible to attack.

Due to the open nature of the map, aggressive players can easily gain an upper edge.

== History ==
The first official Conflict Terra map, CT Eureka was the product of weeks of trying to find a suitable style for the maps to go with Conflict Terra, in addition to finding an easily reproducible method for making the maps.

CT _Eureka_ was obviously named for the triumph of discovery, thanks to the efforts and talents of Wartender, an early contributor to the project.

The map also features the first Conflict Terra dedicated feature, the ct_pinetree.  A shining example of a good idea at the right time, the simple four object model was made very swiftly and yielded a great product; the tree has been complimented on repeatedly, and creates a wonderful amount of life for the map.

Originally having boulder features on the hills for further pizazz, they were removed due to the common confusion of what was a mine-able rock, and what was not.
