## Role ##

|![http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/games/CT/unitpics/bheavysiegemech.png](http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/games/CT/unitpics/bheavysiegemech.png)|Heavily armed SM that fires a salvo of inaccurate shells that are strong against buildings.|
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

The Shimazu Combat Mech acts as a heavy siege unit, firing a salvo of four artillery shells that do high damage to buildings and mild damage to units.  The shells are very inaccurate and land in a wide spread rather than a narrow point.  This makes them more effective against large units, namely buildings.  This also contrasts the [Sekai Type Tank](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGSekaiTypeTank), which fires a single, much more accurate shell.

While it is a slow mech, it is still faster than most tanks.  A handful of these units could deal serious damage to an enemy base, but they are also very expensive.

## History ##
The first quadruped mech I designed, the "bheavysiegemech" drew heavy inspiration from the game series [Armored Core](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armored_core).  Deciding that the Tech Level 2 version of the [Ishida Combat Mech](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGIshidaCombatMech) should be heavy duty to the highest degree, I went with the stable four-legged design.

|Early sketches of the Shimazu as I worked on different designs.|

When designing the legs I wanted them to look well armored and powerful, so I extruded the fronts of the shins to create extended "panels."  I extended the "waist" to give the unit something resembling a tail.

Initially the design called for the guns being mounted on the back or "inside shoulders" of the body, not unlikely the guns for the [Guncannon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guncannon) and [Guntank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RX-75_Guntank) from [Gundam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Suit_Gundam).  However I realized that doing it this way would neglect any need for arms, and I wanted to avoid a bare torso.  After a while of pondering, I realized I could just mount the guns onto the "outside shoulders" to give them an arm-like appearance, and solve my problem!

The actual guns themselves are completely based off of a weapon from [Armored Core 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armored_Core_3).  Of the two grenade launchers available to a player, the lighter option was short and simple, and very closely resembles what we see now on the Shimazu.  This weapon design, for whatever reason, has always been deeply ingrained in what I imagine "heavy weaponry" to look like.

Originally this unit fired two simple shells that did more damage to buildings.  However, it was decided that a way to make the unit more exciting, and therefore more enticing to use, was to give it a more interesting attack.  The unit got an upgrade and now fires a salvo of four shells over a large area.  This inaccuracy makes them better against buildings even beyond simple damage values.  This contrasts the [Sekai Type Tank](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGSekaiTypeTank) which is more accurate but only fires a single shot.

## Name ##
The [Shimazu clan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimazu_clan) was a mighty clan, conquerers of the island of [Kyushu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyushu) and fearsome warriors.  They were present at the pivotal [Battle of Sekigahara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sekigahara), but did not participate because the Shimazu daimyo present had been ridiculed by his fellow samurai when he arrived at the main camp with a bow strung across his back.  Many consider this lack of participation a key factor in the Western Army's defeat.  This daimyo, [Shimazu Yoshihiro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimazu_Yoshihiro), is the particular namesake for the unit, often portrayed as a gruff and powerful warrior, this was the quality I wished the "bheavysiegemech" to convey.

The disk like shields on the outside of the arms were actually added almost entirely because of the units name.  One of the very rare occasions where a units (planned) name affected its model, I added the shoulder pads to imitate the design of Yoshihiro from the game [Samurai Warriors 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samurai_Warriors_2).
