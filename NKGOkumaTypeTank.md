## Role ##

Able to fire two larger anti-mech missiles, the Okuma Type Tank is the bigger brother to the [Kuma Type Tank](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGKumaTypeTank).  What it gains in firepower and armor it loses in speed; the unit is very slow.  Despite this, it can make quick work of most mechs, and a sound choice if the enemy is using a lot of mechs.  In addition to the two larger anti-mech missiles, which deal a larger area-of-effect, it fires two smaller anti-mech missiles at a quicker rate, to maintain pressure on an enemy line.

Because both of these missile types arch, it is possible for players to position the Okuma Type Tank behind wreckage or other cover and shoot over it, protecting the unit.

## Story ##

## History ##
It was around the time I made the Okuma that I began to run out of ideas for the tank line-up.  Exhausting both simple and "interesting" designs on earlier (and weaker) tanks, the Okuma marks the point where I began poking through the internet looking for inspiration.  I had realized that a focal point of a tank is its treads; how they were positioned, and covered (or not covered) by armor, could spice up the interesting value of a tank.

Above is the result of a Google image search looking for interesting tread designs.  The design of this tank is interesting, and immediately grabbed my attention.  I thought the suspension system it had, resembling that of an off-road Jeep or SUV, was pretty neat and decided to mirror it in the tank design.

After the bottom was finished, I set to making the top portion interesting.  Sadly, it is far more generic, and only boasts two pairs of different-sized missile launchers.  The overall look of the tank came out rather intimidating, with the "raised" appearance coming from the suspension adding quite a bit of menace to the unit.

## Name ##
Okuma is one of the more embarrassing names in the NKG.  While the [Kuma Type Tank](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGKumaTypeTank) got its name from the Japanese word for "bear", the Okuma is simply an altered version of that.  In Japanese, "O" is often put in front of a name or word to indicate one of many things:  older, stronger, more divine, more majestic, more important, and sometimes just bigger.  For our Okuma, it simply means "Big Bear."  One of the less original names, it nonetheless works well enough.
