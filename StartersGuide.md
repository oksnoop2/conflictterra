**Caution:  This Starter's Guide is currently a little out of date, due to the shift in how Conflict Terra's economy works.  Once the new system is sufficiently setup, the Starter's Guide will be updated.**

# Starter's Guide #

This guide is intended to help players get a handle on what they should be doing early in the game.  Some basic build suggestions will be listed, with some functionality explained.

  * ## Your Flagship ##

Your Oda Class Cruiser is your Flagship, or Commander for those coming from a Total Annihilation background.  While the game won't end if it is killed under normal circumstances, the Flagship can be powerful early on and critical to starting the building of your base.  The Flagship is unique though in that it does not directly build anything.  The Flagship must morph into the Mobile Headquarters in order to build any units.

It should be noted that the Flagship can also morph into the Owari Class Cruiser, or Battle Flagship.  The Battle Flagship is a one-way morph, in that you cannot return to the normal Flagship, and therefore you cannot morph into the Mobile Headquarters.  The Battle Flagship is a powerful cruiser, armed with several lasers and one powerful laser that can destroy any unit in one hit.  The cost to morph into this unit is very high, however, so it should only be done later in the game when your economy can support it.

  * ## The Mobile Headquarters ##

The Mobile Headquarters is an armed factory, able to fire cannons at ground units and flak at air units.  Engineer Support Mechs can be built at the Mobile Headquarters.  They are your most basic builders, able to build economic buildings, factories, radar stations and defensive turrets.  The Mobile Headquarters can also build Resurrection Teams, which are special units that can repair and resurrect fallen units.

It should be noted that the land flattens underneath the Mobile Headquarters whenever the Flagship morphs into it.  Remember this when picking a position!  If your units are not able to exit the factory because it's dug into a hill, use the Engineer Support Mech's **Restore** function to return the land to its original topography!

The Mobile Headquarters can morph back into the Flagship at any time, so use that to your advantage, either to go on the offensive outside your opponents base, or retreat when the going gets tough.

  * ## Early Economy Suggestions ##

The economy revolves around gathering two resources:  metal and energy.

**Metal** is gathered by building Raw Metal Extractors over metal deposits present in the map.  When you select the Raw Metal Extractor to be built, the map will change to show where metal is present.  Ground where there is no metal will be black, while metal will glow green.  This is a core feature of the Spring Engine, so you will see this in several other Spring Games.

**Energy** is gathered in a more broad way.  There are a handful of buildings in the game that create energy simply by existing.  This is a list of buildings early in the game that create energy:
  * Sterling Power Generator
  * Nuclear Power Plant
The Sterling Power Generator only adds an additional **5 energy** to your income, but it is cheap and builds quickly.  You should build them early to bolster your economy, before you attempt to build the Nuclear Power Plant, which is much more expensive and takes longer to build, but adds a much larger **45 energy** to your income.  Trying to build the Nuclear Power Plant right off the bat will likely result in your economy stalling.

  * ## Storage on Wheels ##
Building several economy buildings, such as Raw Metal Extractors and Sterling Power Generators, is important but not the only part of building a strong economy.  The other part is building appropriate storage units.

The Tetsuda Type Supply Truck and the Raida Type Supply Truck are built at the Support Factory.  These two units provide **25 storage** to metal and energy, respectively.  That isn't a lot of storage by a long shot, however, and so both of them have the option to morph into a stationary storage unit.  While in this deployed form, they each provide **500 storage** to metal and energy, respectively.  They have the ability to morph back into their mobile forms, and so strategic placement of your storage capacity is both easy and changeable.

  * ## Taking to the Field ##

Creating military units is just as important as setting up a sufficient economy, and with those you can both defend against and attack your enemies.  Conflict Terra groups its military units into 6 important groups.  These are:
  * Mechs
  * Tanks
  * Aircraft
  * Ships
  * Submarines
  * Cruisers
This is important because these are the 6 armor groups, explained [here](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/ArmorSystem).  Some units deal especially high damage to special groups, such as the Kuma Type Anti-Mech Tank.  Remembering these strengths and weaknesses will be crucial to you winning, and losing, against others.

While there are of course differences between all of the units, in general these apply:
  * Mechs have less HP, shoot and move faster, and deal more damage than tanks.  They are also generally more expensive and take more time to build than tanks.  Some even have special abilities.
  * Tanks have more HP, shoot and move more slowly, and deal less damage thank mechs.  They also are generally cheaper and build more quickly than mechs.
Picking what kind of units you want to build first is an important decision, and trying to cover all of your bases will be crucial to your success.

  * ## Teching Up ##

All of the initial factories except for the Support Factory have the ability to morph into a Tech Level 2 version of that factory.  These Tech Level 2 factories have the ability to build all of the previously available units, but also are able to build new, stronger units.

One of these new units is the Advanced Engineer Support Mech, which is able to build Tech Level 2 buildings.  Most of these are simply more effective versions of their Tech Level 1 counterparts, but a few new structures are available.  Some examples are:
  * Shield Generator
  * Cruiser Beacon
  * Experimental Build Pad

It should be noted that the Tech Level 2 factories do not build the older units any faster than the Tech Level 1 factories.
