## Role ##

|![http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/games/CT/unitpics/bflyingmech.png](http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/games/CT/unitpics/bflyingmech.png)|Airborne "mech" designed to destroy cruisers.  Fires beam weapons and two AA missiles.  Cannot attack ground.|
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

The Fuma Aerial Combat Mech's main purpose is to destroy Cruisers.  It is armed with six beam weapons that deal high damage to Cruisers.  These beam weapons can only target Cruisers.  It is also able to fire two anti-air missiles, which deal high damage to aircraft than Cruisers.  While somewhat expensive, they are quick units and quite capable of disposing of singled out Cruisers in small packs.  While the anti-air missiles provide some power against aircraft, they are not exceptionally strong, and should have some kind of proper back-up to truly be safe from roaming fighters.

## History ##
To some, the idea of a "flying mech" is an odd, or even dumb one.  I stand by this idea by arguing that mechs themselves are more implausible than plausible, and therefore do not have to abide by reason.  Also, a mech does not have to emulate a human or human shape.  In the very least, I can say that it does not resemble a conventional aircraft, and put the term "flying mech" in quotations, as a compromise to those who will continue to disagree.

|An early sketch of the Fuma.|

The "bflyingmech" was a unit idea I was excited about very early on, and was among the first handful of units I modeled and textured.  Its design was something that changed quite a bit in my mind.  Originally, what I imagined was something more along the lines of the mechs found in [Robotech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotech) or [Macross](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macross), something that greatly resembled an aircraft but also had "humanoid elements."  Its funny that this is what I imagined, because I don't really enjoy either of those anime franchises.

|An example of the stereotypical mech design from Robotech or Macross.|

But I soon decided that such a design would both be too blatantly a rip-off, and that I didn't really want the design anyways.  I turned next to my beloved Gundam, and began to draw emphasis from the [Mobile Armours](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_armour#Mobile_armour) that populate that universe.  In particular I think what I drew from was the idea of a craft that didn't resemble an aircraft or a humanoid mech, but was its own entity.  What I came up with was a very angular machine that in many ways resembled the spacecraft found in the [Playstation game Einhänder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einhänder).  This game blew my mind in a lot of ways when I was young, and I think I was subconsciously channeling its design when modeling the Fuma.

|The spacecraft from Einhänder.|

The plan was to have the mech's parts move and shift for a very animated appearance.  It was going to have landing and flying positions for its body and engines, and I thought it would have helped really bring it alive.  For the longest time, the way to do this eluded me, until Knorke revealed the exceedingly easy way to achieve this.  I quickly scripted in the animations, and brought the Fuma finally to life.

|The Fuma in its older, planned "landed" form.|

An example of one of these early, planned poses is the "landed" form, pictured above.  The mech's engines would have rotated and the fuselage laid on its "back", the large back-mounted engine folding upwards over the head.  While this is a somewhat odd position for the unit, it was conceived in the days of making the mechs actually "work" in a real-world sense.  While that sensibility is still present, it is much weaker when in the face of getting units in-game and fun/memorable.

Due to some of the limitations of the way to do this, I could only work with a landed and flying animation.  I skipped over the "landed" form and decided it would keep its old "neutral" state while it was on the ground.  However, when it took to the air, I could really have fun.

|The Fuma in its forward "flying" form.|

When the Fuma is flying, it leans forward headfirst, with the engines rotating to accommodate this.  The back-mounted "tailfin" also rotates forward.  This pose is a more aggressive one, and I think works well to make the unit seem more alive.

## Name ##
The name Fuma was given to this unit because of its unique role of being a "flying mech."  I felt this implied a special, covert quality to the unit, and so I picked the name of one of the two great ninja clans from Japan, the [Fūma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fūma_Kotarō).  I chose the other clans name, the [Hattori](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hattori_Hanzō), for the Tech Level 2 flying mech, so I guess you could say I think less of the Fūma.  Indeed, their place in Japanese history and legend is lesser, but still something to note.  Ironically, the name Fūma means "Wind Demon", appropriate for this flying war machine.
