## Role ##

|![http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/games/CT/unitpics/bmetaltruck.png](http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/games/CT/unitpics/bmetaltruck.png)|Mobile resurrection unit.  Unarmed.|
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------|

The Resurrection Truck has two main functions:  it can Repair damaged units, something the [Engineer Support Mech](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGEngineerSupportMech) can also do, and it can also Resurrect fallen units that have left wrecks, which the [Engineer Support Mech](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGEngineerSupportMech) _cannot_ do.  While it is by function a builder unit, it cannot build any structures, only Repair and Resurrect.

It should be noted that it can only Resurrect _wrecks_.  Wrecks are the initial category of a destroyed unit.  Wrecks can be either damaged or moved over to create _debris_, which _CANNOT_ be resurrected.

In addition to Repairing and Resurrecting, the Resurrection Truck can also Reclaim features on the map for resources, and Restore the topography of the map.  These are basic functions shared by the [Engineer Support Mech](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGEngineerSupportMech).

## History ##
The Resurrection Truck has had a somewhat long and interesting history.  Not in the original draw-up of the NKG army, the unit was added shortly after playtesting began due to request from Oksnoop2.  When I originally started working on this unit, I decided to make it a hover unit, for little reason other than to make it somewhat unique.

|The original Resurrection "Team" model.|

The design for this unit can't really be traced to any single "inspiration".  It was desired to be sleek, and low to the ground, to help convey a sense of futuristic design.

Initially dubbed the Resurrection Team, this unit was armed with an EMP lightning cannon.  This was provided mostly to give the unit some form of retaliation against enemy units, when out on the battlefield scavenging for wrecks to resurrect.  This, however, proved to be a fearsome weapon.  It was actually early AI testing that revealed the weapon could snipe aircraft out of the sky, stun them, and then cause them to fall to the ground helpless and self-destruct.  The AI built copious amounts of them, probably because they are technically builders, and these armies of what were essentially EMP hover tanks could wreak havoc on players.

The ability for them to fire at air was of course removed, but the AI still built several of them, and used them to immobilize almost any army.  Finally, this feature was removed due to the headache of balancing it, and the "breztank" has been unarmed ever since.

However, calling it a tank caused some confusion for players.  It was assumed by many that a tank would be armed in some way, and so most players were disappointed to discover the twenty cheap tanks they just made could in fact not attack the enemy, despite the clear description that it was Unarmed.  After some discussion we decided that using the then scrapped [Tetsuda Type Supply Truck](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGTetsudaTypeSupplyTruck) model would help remove the tank connotation attached to the unit.  After scaling down the model, it was replaced and the Resurrection Truck was born.

The model originally used for the [Tetsuda Type Supply Truck](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGTetsudaTypeSupplyTruck) was heavily inspired by contemporary Armored Personnel Carriers, specifically one used by a [character](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Metal_Gear_series#Drebin_893) in [Metal Gear Solid 4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_gear_solid_4).  The design is for the most part faithful to this real vehicle.  An open bed was given to the unit, with folding doors to protect what was originally girders of steel.  When this model was re-used for the Resurrection Truck, the girders were removed.

## Name ##
Originally called the Resurrection Team, the idea was that the unit was more of a representative "avatar" for a crew of workers who would spill out of the vehicle, and quickly get a mech or tank back up and running.  I always liked this idea, and I still hold onto it in my mind, but I've since decided to just call it a Resurrection Truck, to make more sense to the common player.

The unit wasn't given a Japanese name for the same reason as the [Engineer Support Mech](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGEngineerSupportMech).  Despite what name I gave it, it would always best be known by its role.
