The Drone Warrior is the backbone of the Drone forces. This tough unit shoots a short, accurate laser that is deadly in force. He is able to clone and create a massive army in a matter of minutes. When in force, a pack of Drone Warriors is able to level entire bases. It can also attack aircraft, though its specialty is ground units.


# **Drone Warrior's Design** #

The Drone Warrior's design is a simple one. A central hub, controlled either by itself as a robot or an alien is unknown, is suspended by four metal legs. In the center of this hub is a red box, which is the Warrior's eye. Directly below this hub is the laser attachment. This is where the Drone Warrior's devastating powers emerge from.
