## Role ##

|![http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/games/CT/unitpics/badvengineermkii.png](http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/games/CT/unitpics/badvengineermkii.png)|Newer model of the Engineer Support Mech, capable of constructing more complex buildings.  Unarmed.|
|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

The Advanced Engineer Support Mech differs from its Tech Level 1 cousin in that it has only one role:  it is a builder.  Thats right, the Advanced Engineer Support Mech is _not_ capable of mining meteorites.

I repeat, the Advanced Engineer Support Mech is _not_ a miner.

With that out of the way, the Advanced Engineer Support Mech is the key to building Tech Level 2 structures.  These include the Tech Level 2 "factories", defensive turrets, and the special Defense Ships.  It is also able to build the economic buildings, which may be considered Tech Level 1.

Like the Tech Level 1 [Engineer Support Mech](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGEngineerSupportMech), this Tech Level 2 version has the following qualities:

  * Only one Advanced Engineer Support Mech can work on a building at a time.  No assisting.
  * The Advanced Engineer Support Mech cannot assist "factories" in building their units.

It should be noted that the above rules apply to both of the NKG builder units.

When reaching Tech Level 2, it is often times a good idea to invest in one or two of these units, so that the player can build either the [Experimental Build Pad](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGExperimentalBuildPad) or the [Advanced Cruiser Beacon](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGAdvancedCruiserBeacon), both of which produce fearsome units.

## Story ##
Coming soon!

## History ##
The original Advanced Engineer Support Mech was modeled quickly and with little thought, simply relying on a design philosophy of "bigger and badder."  Very closely resembling its Tech Level 1 cousin, the new unit was given a pair of crane booms instead of a single (and sensible) one.  This was admittedly a very dumb idea, and I never liked it.

|The original model for the Advanced Engineer Support Mech.|

When the [Engineer Support Mech](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGEngineerSupportMech) was remodeled, it was decided this unit had to follow, both to match its weaker counterpart, and just because the existing model was dumb.  When working on ideas for this new unit, I decided to give it actual legs, instead of using the somewhat offbeat idea of a track-driven "mech."  I drifted to a "reverse-joint" leg design, although you may notice the proportions of this units legs are different from the usual.  Whereas usually I made the "thigh" either shorter than or the same size as the "shin", I decided to flip-flop the proportions and make the "shin" shorter than the "thigh."  This was directly the result of looking at the [Viking](http://starcraft.wikia.com/wiki/Viking) unit from the newly released [Starcraft 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starcraft_2).

|The Viking from Starcraft 2.|

It may be difficult to notice, but one may note the low angle at which the Viking's shins came from the feet.  This is what I sought to replicate.

As for the upper body, it was modeled to very closely resemble its new Tech Level 1 counterpart.  The welding mask of the smaller unit was excused, but the small, insect-like arms were kept.  Instead of being welding arms, they were instead given "grabbers", meant to hold whatever the unit would be welding.  An extra pair of welding arms were attached to the sides of the unit, to resemble humanoid arms.  This marked the first four armed mech for the NKG.

The animation for the small "grabbers" was taken directly from the animation developed for the welding arms of the [Engineer Support Mech](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGEngineerSupportMech), and so the unit has an appearance similar to that of a crab or other crayfish eating; the little arms are constantly moving as the unit is "active."

## Name ##
Like its Tech Level 1 version, this unit was never given a Japanese name of any kind simply for the reason that even a good one could not replace its very role.  It was a builder, an engineer unit that would always be called that.  I feel this was the right choice.
