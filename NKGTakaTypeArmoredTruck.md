## Role (Mobile Mode) ##

|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

The Taka Type Armored Truck has two different modes: a [mobile, but much weaker mode](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGTakaTypeArmoredTruck#Role_(Mobile_Mode)), which attacks with a single anti-air missile, and an [immobile, but much stronger mode](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGTakaTypeArmoredTruck#Role_(Turret_Mode)), which attacks with a pair of flak cannons.  To change between these two modes, players must Morph the Taka Type Armored Truck.  The Morph does not cost any resource but time, taking 2 seconds to complete the Morph.

While in the mobile Taka Type Armored Truck form, the unit is relatively weak, firing a single anti-air missile.  Indeed, while in this form it is actually _weaker_ than its Tech Level 1 counterpart, the [Yumi Type Jeep](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGYumiTypeJeep).  The single missile is intended to be some small defense as the unit moves between positions in which it can deploy.

## Role (Turret Mode) ##

The Taka Type Armored Truck has two different modes: a [mobile, but much weaker mode](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGTakaTypeArmoredTruck#Role_(Mobile_Mode)), which attacks with a single anti-air missile, and an [immobile, but much stronger mode](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGTakaTypeArmoredTruck#Role_(Turret_Mode)), which attacks with a pair of flak cannons.  To change between these two modes, players must Morph the Taka Type Armored Truck.  The Morph does not cost any resource but time, taking 2 seconds to complete the Morph.

The Taka Type Anti-Air Turret is the immobile form of the Taka Type Armored Truck.  While in this mode, the unit uses a pair of rapid-firing flak cannons to tear through aircraft.  Useful even in small numbers in most situations, this unit can provide a versatile and mobile anti-air protection force for an army on the move.  They can also help protect players as they make or move bases often.

It should be noted that while in this mode, it does not fire the anti-air missile used in the mobile form.

## Story ##
Coming soon!

## History ##
The Taka Type Armored Truck was the first ground-based anti-air unit that could move, despite its need to deploy to be truly useful.  It was conceived as an answer to many requests for a mobile anti-air unit that was not a plane, that allowed me to keep my distance from overly-effective anti-air units that were swift as well.  The [Yumi Type Jeep](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGYumiTypeJeep) would ironically later fulfill this role.

This unit was also the first to utilize the idea of a deployable turret, an idea taken from the [trebuchet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trebuchet) of [Age of Empires 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Empires_II:_The_Age_of_Kings).  These super-weapons had to also be deployed (or "unpacked"), which required them to be used carefully.  This helped keep players from relying heavily on them, instead promoting (sometimes) the use of small, effective teams of trebuchets instead of massive mindless armies.  It was this idea that I wanted to maintain in Conflict Terra.

As far as the appearance of the unit goes, it was a cobbled-together unit.  The actual truck of the unit is rather odd looking, having a slopping bed and a funny-looking cab.  I'm not especially fond of its appearance, but it gets the job done, and the unit is not used enough to prompt me to update it.  This unit was also the first wheeled unit in Conflict Terra.

|The stabilizers used on modern day fire trucks.|

When it deploys, I mirrored the stabilizers used by modern fire trucks.  As a child I had a large fire truck toy that used these stabilizers, which no doubt inspired me when I was modeling the unit.  The turret itself raises on a boom, also reminiscent of a fire truck, and is ready to fire.

## Name ##
The name taka is the Japanese word for hawk, given for the obvious purpose of this being a unit tied to the air, despite its tether to the ground.  A weak name, it is nonetheless short and easy to remember.
