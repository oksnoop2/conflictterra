## Role ##

The Ogami Type Tank fulfills the role of a bigger, better, hardier [Oukami Type Tank](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGOukamiTypeTank).  Having a little over twice as much HP, this tank can take a good amount of damage.  Like its Tech Level 1 counterpart, it is not the best at dealing damage, but en masse it can get the job done.  They excel at providing a line for units to fall back to, or in defending a base.

## History ##
The design for the Ogami is one I'm fond of.  Breaking the usual mold for what a tank should look like, this unit is able to both look somewhat unique and heavily armored.  I mainly drew inspiration from one of my favorite vehicles in the [Star Wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_wars) canon, the [Armored Assault Tank](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/AAT), or AAT.

|The Trade Federation tank, or AAT.|

I loved the design of this tank as a kid, and when brainstorming a design for the basic Tech Level 2 tank, this is what I thought of.  The similarity is pretty obvious, with the forward "shovel"-like shape of the body, and the rear-mounted turret.  Unlike the AAT, the Ogami is a normal treaded tank.

When I had finished with the basic design, I sought to spice up the appearance.  I began playing with cutting up the faces and pulling edges out.  What I came up with is the jagged, mostly pointless array found on the front of the tank.  This is one of the first models that I began adding these little details of fluff, found on later units.

Despite my extreme dislike of the [Halo series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(series)), it was pointed out to me the strong resemblance between the Ogami and one of the tanks in the games, the [Wraith](http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Type-25_Assault_Gun_Carriage).  The similarities are harder to see than with the AAT, but they are still there, notably the forward swept front and rear-oriented cannon.  You could say all three of these tanks are similar.

## Name ##
The Ogami is one of the few tanks named after a person, albeit a fictional one.  Derived from [Ogami Itt≈ç](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogami_itto), the main character of the Japanese comic _Lone Wolf and Cub_, the name Ogami itself is a play on the Japanese word for wolf, ookami.  This correlates with the [Oukami Type Tank](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGOukamiTypeTank), itself a play on the word for wolf.  These two units are bound in their similar roles, although one is stronger than the other.
