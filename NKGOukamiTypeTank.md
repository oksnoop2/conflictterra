The Oukami Type Tank is one of the most basic units available to NKG players.  It shoots a single projectile that deals no extra damage to anything.  Slow, but having more HP than the usual Tech Level 1 mech, the Oukami Type Tank excels in defending a base, or holding a strategic point on the map.  They are usually a safe investment, due to their low cost and versatile use.

They work well accompanying [Kuma Type Tanks](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGKumaTypeTank).

## History ##
The significance of the Oukami Type Tank in the creation of Conflict Terra and the NKG is very much notable.  It was the first unit I brought into the game and made do what it was supposed to do.  That is, I was able to get it in-game, and shoot its weapon!  I had brought a model in-game before, but it was not sized appropriately, and was supposed to be a flying unit so that would require more work!  So it was the Oukami Type Tank that was able to be a sort of Adam and Eve for every other unit in Conflict Terra;  every other unit shared its animation script for the longest time, and its Unit Def was the basis for all of the other units.  Because of this, I often times have called this unit the "Godfather Unit."

Despite being the second unit I brought in-game, it was not the second I had modeled.  I had already modeled the [Hojo Combat Mech](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGHojoCombatMech), the first version of the [Honda Combat Mech](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGHondaCombatMech), and a few other units before I started working on what would become the Oukami.  I was, naturally, most interesting in working on the mechs and cruisers that I had stewing in my brain, but realized early on that making the mechs walk would be an endeavor in and of itself, which proved to be true.  It was at this crucial moment that I could have abandoned the project, downtrodden by the brick wall that was animation, but I instead chose to keep on going forward.  Tanks, I reasoned, were easy to animate (for the animation script given to us was for a typical tank design!) so I figured the walking animation would someday be fixed.  I set to work on the "bassaulttank."

Inspiration for the Oukami came chiefly and obviously from the [Magella Attack tank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_61_Tank#HT-01B_Magella_Attack) from none other than [Mobile Suit Gundam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Suit_Gundam).  I always really liked the design of these tanks, finding their central "tower" design an interesting and refreshing one.  I sought of course to emulate this in my first tank.

The front "cow catcher" on the base of the Oukami is something I can't really explain the story behind.  All I can really say is that I was obviously trying to make the unit more interesting or menacing, and extruded faces on the model slowly became what we see today.  I would like to say, however, that I personally don't really view the part as a "cow catcher", and instead like to think of it as thickened front armor, or a device to help push away rubble as the tank is rolling along the battlefield.

The Oukami is a unit I love for many reasons, and I don't believe I would ever have the heart to remodel or redo it.

## Name ##
The name Oukami is a slightly altered version of the Japanese word for "wolf".  The actual romanization would be ookami, pronounced in a sort of odd "o okami".  Deciding that a faithful translation would no doubt look silly to most people, I changed the second o to u instead give the beginning of the word a long o.  This alteration is slight and I feel a good one for the common person who has no idea of any of the mechanics in the Japanese language.

The actual decision to name the tank "wolf" was mostly inspired by the character [Ogami Ittō](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogami_Ittō) from the manga Lone Wolf and Cub.  One of my all-time favorite comics to come from Japan, I used this name mostly to reflect my affection for the unit.  You may of course note that another [unit](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGOgamiTypeTank) actually has the name Ogami.  This unit was given the actual name to signify its stronger position in the NKG army.
