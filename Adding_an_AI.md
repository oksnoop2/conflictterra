# What AI Should I Pick? #

At the moment, three AI work well enough with Conflict Terra to be playable against.  These include:
  * **RAI 0.601**
> A relatively easy to play against AI, that comes packaged with the Spring installer.  Builds slowly, and should provide a good environment to get more familiar with the game.
  * **E323AI 3.22.3**
> A very aggressive AI that is difficult to play against, this would provide more of a challenge.  This AI also comes packaged with the Spring installer.
  * **Shard**
> Being developed by AF, Shard is an easy to configure AI.  We provide [configuration](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/source/browse/#svn/AIconfigs/shard/ct) files, but you can write your own and try to make a more challenging AI!

**NullAI 0.1** is another potential option.  NullAI does absolutely nothing, and can be useful for trying out the game with absolutely no fear of being destroyed.
