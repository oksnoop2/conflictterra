## Role ##

|![http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/games/CT/unitpics/bfightermkii.png](http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/games/CT/unitpics/bfightermkii.png)|Fast, light fighter armed with two air cannons.|
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|

The Hayabusa Type Fighter MkII fulfills one role and it fulfills well:  it is an air-superiority fighter.  Inexpensive, fast, and armed with a pair of aircraft-to-aircraft cannons, a squad of Hayabusa can make quick work of most aircraft.  Most players will find it prudent to have a handful of these units to help protect their airspace, and to possibly scout the enemy.  They are not the toughest aircraft out there, but they excel offensively.

They are only effective against aircraft and the flying mechs.  They do little damage to cruisers, requiring the use of [Suzaku Type Fighter MkIIIs](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGSuzakuTypeFighter).  However, they do well when mixed in with the Suzaku Type Fighter MkIIIs because they will be able to counter any other air-superiority fighters.

## History ##
The original fighter for the NKG was among the first units modeled and textured.  The initial design was an odd yet iconic one; it resembled the [Core Fighter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Fighter#FF-X7_Core_Fighter) from [Mobile Suit Gundam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Suit_Gundam), in addition to relying on the [canard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canard_(aeronautics)) wing design used in early aircraft.

The first texture for the unit was among the first five textures I did for any units that would eventually be in CT.  Not yet deciding on a definitive color scheme, I purposely gave it a strong Core Fighter aesthetic just to see how it looked.  In the end, however, I was both not happy with it and not wanting to get too close to any particular mecha franchise in style.  After some time the color scheme for aircraft was decided to be a combination of light greys and white, and so the unit was retextured.

|An example of early sketches for the design of the unit.|

The bfighter proceeded to serve faithfully for a long time.  In time, however, I began to grow weary of the appearance of a lot of the aircraft for the NKG.  Eventually a massive overhaul of the aircraft began, and the bfighter couldn't escape it.

Despite the iconic design of the fighter, it was decided it too would receive a remodeling.  The biggest reason for this was simply that the canard wing design is apparently not a very maneuverable one, and so it would be stupid for the design of the workhorse anti-aircraft fighter to not be agile, regardless of the fact that it would have no bearing on actual gameplay.

However, finding a suitable replacement design was tough.  I tried looking for other unique aircraft designs in the real world, and didn't really find any that struck me as satisfying.  Ultimately I modeled a rather ordinary looking jet aircraft, incorporating a turbine on each wing and extra fuel pods on the tip of each wing.

The overall look of the new model was strongly reminiscent of the earlier jet aircraft of the 20th century, when engineers were still trying to figure out the best design for supersonic fighters.  From the beginning, the unit was given anti-air cannons as its weapon instead of homing missiles.  This was done mostly because there was a desire to create actual dogfights between fighters, instead of just an exchange of aircraft-seeking missiles.  In this way, the Hayabusa is truly a homage to early jet fighters.

## Name ##
The unit's original name was the Tori Type Fighter.  This was a painfully unoriginal name for the aircraft, as tori is the Japanese word for bird.  When the unit was remodeled and given a stylistic overhaul, along with the rest of the aircraft, it was decided to give it a new name.  Hayabusa is the Japanese word for falcon, a much more precise and intimidating name for the aircraft.  Unfortunately, a rather famous [fictional ninja](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryu_Hayabusa) shares the name Hayabusa, a character from the video game series' [Dead or Alive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_or_Alive_(series)) and [Ninja Gaiden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_Gaiden).  It's true, the unit was not named after the video game character.

The unit was given the designation Mark 2, or MkII, because it was the second version of the unit.
