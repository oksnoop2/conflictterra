## Role ##

|![http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/games/CT/unitpics/bmissilemech.png](http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/games/CT/unitpics/bmissilemech.png)|Light SM built to combat other mechs.  Fires two bursts of anti-mech missiles.|
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

The Ueda Combat Support Mech is a lightly armored counter mech that specializes in anti-mech warfare.  It attacks by firing two volleys of anti-mech missiles at the same time.  Each volley is comprised of three missiles, totaling in six.  The missiles stay in a tightly packed trajectory, and most are likely to hit a target.  While the Ueda Combat Support Mech can destroy buildings and other units sufficiently when en masse, they are not hardy and are likely to be taken out easily.  They have a Sprint function, which when activated, will allow the Ueda Combat Support Mech to move very quickly for 10 seconds.  A 20 second recharge period follows.

They work well when combined with the [Enkei Combat Support Mech](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGEnkeiCombatSupportMech), an anti-tank unit.

## Story ##
Coming soon!

## History ##
The Ueda Combat Support Mech was actually modeled a long time into Conflict Terra's life.  The role had been defined from the start, but I neglected to come up with a "good design" for it.  It was among the final units modeled before playtesting began with my friends.  I actually struggled for a while trying to come up with a design I liked.  Below is an example of a finished model that never got textured.

|An early model for the Missile Mech.|

I was unhappy with this one for several reasons.  I was experimenting with leg-styles, and this was the result of pushing the "reverse-joint" style too far.  I also felt the missile pods were too large, and it gave the unit a somewhat rabbit-like appearance.

The model I made next is what made it into the game.  I went with a simplified leg design, and in general tried to simplify the whole unit.  What I came up with was a reasonable looking unit that rather resembled the [AT-ST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT-ST#All_Terrain_Scout_Transport_.28AT-ST.29) that makes this leg style so famous.

This unit is also somewhat unique in that it is the first unit I made where the legs made a perfect right angle at the knee.  In other words, they looked like this:

|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Note the 90 degree angle.|

The two previous reverse-joint leg mechs had legs that were positioned more like this:

|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Note the sharper angle.|

For the longest time the "bmissilemech" just fired a volley of two anti-mech missiles, one from each pod, exactly like its tank counterpart, the [Kuma Type Tank](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGKumaTypeTank).  Much later, when I was trying to think of a way to legitimize the use of the more expensive mechs via making them "special," it came to me to give the anti-mech mech a more explosive type of attack, and so the bursts of missile were born.  It has worked well, making the Ueda a formidable unit against mechs.

It was a decent amount of time after that development that the Ueda was finally given the Sprint ability.  Many thanks to Car Repairer for getting that working for us.

## Name ##
Ueda, being a name given later in the NKG's development, is a name taken from [Ueda Castle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ueda_Castle), the stronghold of the famous Sanada family of Sengoku Jidai Japan.  At this point I was running out of samurai and daimyo names, and so I decided to pull the name of a castle out for this.  I'd always been fond of the name Ueda, both for its sound and meaning.  Ue (上) being the Japanese word for "up" or "above", and da (田) being the Japanese word for "field" or "rice pattie."  It could be either taken as a higher rice field, being better than the others, or as the point of view being the castle is above the lowly rice field and its peasantry.  A classic example of the Japanese and their love of puns.

Sadly, there was no real reason for giving this unit the name of Ueda other than I needed a cool name and this is what I thought of.
