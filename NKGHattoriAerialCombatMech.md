## Role ##

|![http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/games/CT/unitpics/bheavyflyingmech.png](http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/games/CT/unitpics/bheavyflyingmech.png)|Fires a powerful beam to deal heavy damage to Cruisers.|
|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------|

The Hattori Aerial Combat Mech serves one role:  to shoot down enemy Cruisers.  Firing a single, powerful beam, it can deal heavy damage to the flying focal points of the NKG.  The Hattori Aerial Combat Mech is, however, the most expensive mech at the [Matsudaira Class Cruiser Mech Factory](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGMatsudairaClassCruiser), so only the very wealthy and successful will be able to build them.

It should be noted they can only fire at Cruisers, and cannot target aircraft.

## History ##
While the [Fuma Aerial Combat Mech](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGFumaAerialCombatMech) was inspired by the [Mobile Armour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_armour#Mobile_armour)'s of [Gundam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundam), the Hattori Aerial Combat Mech was more intimately designed after the Mobile Armours.  Wanting a large, foreboding, and intemedating appearance for this "bheavyflyingmech", I looked at some of the most fearsome of the Mobile Armours in Gundam's [Universal Century](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Century) timeline.  What I looked at most was none other than the awesome [Neue Ziel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMA-002_Neue_Ziel#AMA-002_.28AMA-X2.2C_AMX-002.29_Neue_Ziel).

|The Neue Ziel from Stardust Memory.|

Appearing in [Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardust_Memory), the Neue Ziel is a fearsome Mobile Armour that duels the main protagonist in the final battle of the series.  Swift, heavily armed and heavily armored, the Neue Ziel is my favorite Mobile Armour.  It was only natural I looked to this unit for designing inspiration.

|An early sketch of the Hattori.|

The overall design obviously carried over strongly.  A central "body", surrounded by thruster-mounted "limbs" that are used to control the "flying" weapon, the Hattori has the potential to be a frightening weapon.  I decided a humanoid head would make little sense on a body like this, so I opted for no visible cockpit, the pilot instead relying on several cameras (much like several Mobile Suits in the Gundam universe.)

I did however give the Hattori a single, central weapon.  Fired from the front "nozzle", the powerful beam weapon can wreak havoc on the enemy.

Originally, before we had LUPs in the game, the model was as it is in Wings3D.  After we added LUPs effects into the game, the Hattori, like the [Fuma Aerial Combat Mech](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGFumaAerialCombatMech), was given thruster effects to help realize the image of the unit.  This has helped a lot.  Also like the [Fuma Aerial Combat Mech](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGFumaAerialCombatMech), movement of the thruster "limbs" was planned into the unit, with various movements meant to convey different types of movements.  This was finally implemented after Knorke revealed the painfully easy way to do this.  It really brought the unit to life, allowing it to shift into a much more reasonable and "battle-ready" position.

|The Hattori in its flying mode.|

The unit has had a long history of being overpowered.  Indeed, in early playtesting it was so powerful that if a player could secure a handful of them, victory was almost guaranteed.  Originally a general-purpose unit, the Hattori was later reconditioned to be specifically an anti-Cruiser unit.  The weapon was restricted from targeting other unit types, and deals high damage to cruisers.  This was done to help steer the unit into a specific role, alongside its weaker cousin, the [Fuma Aerial Combat Mech](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGFumaAerialCombatMech).

## Name ##
Named after the infamous [Hattori Hanzō](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hattori_Hanzō) of the Hattori clan, the reason for giving this name was that the Hattori would be the ultimate in "special warfare".  Able to fly over any terrain, and deliver immense damage, the Hattori is much like the legends of its namesake.  The several Hattori Hanzōs of history have cultivated an immense cultural significance that persists to this day in [movies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hattori_Hanzo_(Kill_Bill)), [video games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Samurai_Shodown_characters#Hanzo_Hattori), and [comic books](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_of_the_Assassin).
