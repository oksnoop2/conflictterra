## Description ##
Conflict Terra has taken off from Earth!  CT Conflict Luna is a lunar map, taking place on the moon.  Flat plains, deep craters, and silver moon dust give this map an appropriately barren feeling.  In the distance, the Earth is visible, as the fight for Earth goes on off her hallowed surface.

## Tactics ##
Players starting in the top left and bottom right corners have the greatest advantage, due to more easily accessible resources.  Despite this, players in the opposite corners have easier to defend bases due to large craters.

There are a handful of key positions on the map which, if controlled by a player, will give them a noticeable advantage.  Most of these positions lie between the craters and the short plateaus that are in the middle of the map.  These points are easy to defend and are good places for radar towers due to the raised terrain.

While NKG players can access the bottom of the craters, Drone players will find it easier to mine resources there due to their all-terrain nature and simpler mining system.  It is, however, difficult to defend or flee if attacked in one of these craters.

## History ##
The map was conceived as something to add some variety to the growing repertoire of Conflict Terra maps.  Different natural Earthly environments were beginning to run their course, and this was one of the "other-worldy" ideas presented.

The map itself was quickly made, and proved to be a nice change of pace.  It stands as one of the finer Conflict Terra maps.
