## Role ##

Fulfilling the role of a "bigger and badder" [Ueda Combat Support Mech](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGUedaCombatSupportMech), the Shibata Combat Support Mech MkII is a fearsome destroyer of mechs.  Able to fire a salvo of ten anti-mech missiles at once, the Shibata Combat Support Mech MkII is also able to take a decent beating.  Hardier than the [Honda Combat Mech MkII](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGHondaCombatMech), but also slower, the Shibata Combat Support Mech MkII can take up the role of a front-line unit, although it too should have some backup.

## History ##
Conceived as nothing more than a bigger and stronger anti-mech mech, this unit was modeled later in the initial creation of units.  Not long before playtesting began I had to wrap up the remaining units, the units I had little inspiration or ideas for.  This unit was one of those.

|The original model for the Shibata Combat Support Mech.|

The original model was a rushed job, the classic combination of okay ideas and poor execution.  Deciding that a unit "loaded down" with missile launching pods would be the way to go, I put such pods on the shoulders and hips.  When going with this design I couldn't help but think of the [Gunsniper](http://zoids.wikia.com/wiki/Gunsniper) from [Zoids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoids), specifically the [New Century Zero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoids:_New_Century_Zero) series.  The Gunsniper used in this series was customized to use the "Wild Weasel" weapons array, a ridiculous load-out of missiles, lasers, and guns.  The missile pods in this customization were a heavy inspiration for the Shibata.

When I came to the head, something in me said to avoid the typical setup of a humanoid head.  I actually sought to imitate the head of the [Krogoth](http://modinfo.adune.nl/index.php?act=edit&side=core&id=21&MOD=ba719), from [Total Annihilation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Annihilation), the dreaded enemy of Conflict Terra.  Its ironic though, considering retrospectively the similarities to the [Gunsniper](http://zoids.wikia.com/wiki/Gunsniper).

The missile pod arms were a poor decision as well.  Their execution was even poorer.  Each of these arms fired a barrage of three missiles, which when combined with the two missiles fired from each shoulder and hip mounted pod, came to a grand total of fourteen missiles fired from this unit.  A bit excessive to say the least.

The unit was never loved and saw brief stints of heavy use due to imbalances; it was seemingly always overpowered.  One particular game saw especially heavy use when a player decided to use copious amounts of the unbalanced unit, which could fire at aircraft at the time.  The enormous amount of missiles it could fire resulted in the map literally raining missiles for moments at a time.  The fourteen missiles from each unit could of course not hit the nimble aircraft, and so they came crashing to the ground after their fuel was spent.

Its accessibility was eventually cut off, along with the rest of Tech Level 2.  It was around this time that I began designing a new model for the unit.  This new design has a somewhat interesting history.  It was conceived while I was brainstorming the idea of a "beefier" [Hojo Combat Mech](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGHojoCombatMech).  I wasn't wanting to redesign the [Hojo Combat Mech](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGHojoCombatMech), but was playing with the idea of customized mechs for "Ace Pilots" in the NKG.  My trail of thought centered around the [Hojo Combat Mech's](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGHojoCombatMech) small shields guarding its Rapid Fire Cannon "hands."  I thought of making them larger, more circular and "Ancient Greek-like."  From there I began to imagine a beefier, stockier mech in general.  I began doodling this idea, for I felt it was a good one.  When I was finished, I liked what I had come up with.  Determining that it was too good to waste, I began thinking about what I could use it for.

|A more refined sketch, done the next day while I was at work.|

Ah ha!  Of course!  The awful old Tech Level 2 anti-mech mech.  I made a model based on my doodle, and asked for a critique from the Spring Community.  There was something about the doodle that wasn't conveyed in the model; something was missing, to give it that "good" quality.  The model sat unfinished for months, as I focused instead on the balancing and reshaping of Tech Level 1.

Finally, when it was determined to bring Tech Level 2 back into the game, I finished this unit.  Pulling my act together, I fixed the model, textured it, and brought it in-game.  The [Ueda Combat Mech](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGUedaCombatSupportMech) had since had an upgrade, being able to fire a barrage of clustered missiles.  I decided to retain this form of attack, increasing its volume and power for this Tech Level 2 unit.

Shortly after it was doodled, I thought the unit looked like it could use a "charging" type of attack in a "real life" setting.  What I imagined was the unit crouching forward slightly, and moving its shielded arms up front of its "face", and rushing the enemy.  This "Charge" would have been a linear attack, causing low-to-medium damage and ideally having a slight repulsive quality to push back the enemy.  It was, however, deemed too difficult to do, as it would require an entirely new gadget written.  The unit can NOT use this attack.  Someday we may see this move on the Shibata Combat Support Mech MkII, and it will be a good day.

## Name ##
Shibata comes from the samurai [Shibata Katsuie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibata_Katsuie), an important and loyal servant to [Oda Nobunaga.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oda_Nobunaga)  Shibata is often portrayed as an able yet gruff general, something I wanted to convey with this powerful unit.  Amusingly, I feel the second design for the unit better fits the name than the first.
