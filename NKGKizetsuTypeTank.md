## Role ##

|![http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/games/CT/unitpics/bempcannon.png](http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/games/CT/unitpics/bempcannon.png)|Tank armed with a long range, very slow firing EMP beam that can pierce shields. Must build ammo, 1000 energy per shot.  Must be told to fire.|
|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

The Kizetsu Type Tank fulfills a very niche role of being able to paralyze any unit for a length of time.  It does not deal any damage to the unit's HP, instead only stunning it.

The Kizetsu Type Tank's ammo must be built by the player.  Each shot requires 1000 energy to build, and takes 20 seconds to build.  Because of this ammo system, the Kizetsu Type Tank must be manually fired by the player; it won't fire at enemies on its own.

While this may seem like a difficult to use unit, players will find that it will paralyze _any unit_ in the game for 5 seconds, and has a reasonable blast radius.  If used properly, this unit can effectively stop an enemy army.  It should be noted that the weapon will paralyze any friendly units, so use it carefully.

## Story ##
Coming soon!

## History ##
This unit was originally conceived as a counter to the no-longer-present [Shield Generator](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGShieldGenerator).  It was designed to be the one unit that could penetrate the shields, allowing other units to then fire on the structure to bring it down.  This mechanic was clunky and hard to execute, however, and it was eventually decided to scrap the Shield Generator altogether.

With the Shield Generator gone, the unit saw no use until we decided to revamp it with a makeover.  Originally, the unit operated like the [Taka Type Armored Truck](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGTakaTypeArmoredTruck) in that it had two modes, an unarmed mobile form and the immobile turret mode.  This was implemented to help keep the unit in check, meaning to mirror the [trebuchets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trebuchet) of [Age of Empires 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Empires_II:_The_Age_of_Kings).  However, it was removed to make the unit more appealing.  Already dreadfully slow, we felt giving the unit a normal firing style would make it easier to use.  The ammo system was implemented to help keep the unit powerful, and therefore useful, but to prevent it from being overly so.

The flat appearance of the unit was an attempt to spread out the variety in the unit shapes.  It is also unique in that it only has three treads:  one on the left, one on the right, and a wide one in the rear.  The actual gun is an example of gun barrels I've really liked.

## Name ##
Kizetsu is the Japanese word for "paralyze."  The choice was obvious, as I intended to sidestep the common Japanese names that use the particles "rai" or "den", often associated with lightning and electricity.
