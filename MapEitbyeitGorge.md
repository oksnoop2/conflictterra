## Description ##
CT Eitbyeit Gorge is a small map, focusing on a pair of mountains that form a narrow gorge between them.  An old dried river bed bisects the map, drawing the definitive lines in the sand for two players.  A mixed forest of pine and maple trees surrounds the map.

## Tactics ##
CT Eitbyeit Gorge is a small map intended for one on one battles.  Each player has three main directions to defend: the mountain in the center, and the paths on either side of the mountain.

  * Tanks cannot climb the mountains in the middle.
  * Tanks can cross the dried river bed.
  * Mechs can climb the mountains in the middle.

Large meteor supplies are on each side of the gorge, but players should be wary of mining so close to the enemy.  Mining camps should be defended!  Units with Jump Jets can leap to either side of the gorge from the bottom, but may have a hard time Jumping from one side to the other.

## History ##
The first map ever made with the "CT style", it sat for a long time as a testing map due to it's small size.  It was pulled into action for one on one's when the desire was made known for a small map.  Originally the map had a very low softness, but this was remedied.

The name Eitbyeit Gorge is a butchering of "8 x 8", the name given to it during its days as a test map.
