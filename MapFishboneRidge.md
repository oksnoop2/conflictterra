## Description ##
CT Fishbone Ridge is an interesting map.  A spine-like ridge runs through the middle, with the main four starting spots in small canyons jutting from the ridge.  Cacti grow in small clumps, or out by themselves in this desert landscape.

## Tactics ##
The first four starting spots are situated in each of the protective canyons.  Players can begin relatively safely in these canyons, expecting normal attacks from the left or right.  It should be warned, however, that Jump Jet capable units can leap down from the top of the canyon wall and attack the usual safety of a starting player.

  * Tanks cannot climb to the central plateau.
  * Mechs can climb to the central plateau.
  * Only all-terrain units can climb to the top of the canyons.

Usually the first half of a game sees players moving on the outskirts of the map, collecting resources and fighting proxy wars.  Later in the game, remaining players usually move into the center for the mine-able rocks that are usually left untouched.

Tanks don't play a strong late-game due to their inability to climb the central plateau.  Despite this, they can still have a strong early presence for any players who have not yet moved to the high ground.

Ambushes from the top of the canyons are not unheard of, and players should be careful.

## History ##
CT Fishbone Ridge was the result of an idea to turn a map "inside out."  Oksnoop2, the main mapmaker for Conflict Terra, noticed how several maps are somewhat bowl shaped, having an outlying wall to push players into an open middle.  He inverted this idea, going with an idea of having an inside wall, pushing players out and away from each other.

The idea created an interesting map design that received a warm welcome.  The map plays well and provides a change of pace from the usual RTS map design.

The map was the first to feature a set of cactus features for Conflict Terra.  The relatively simple features look great and add a nice level of depth to the map.

The name Fishbone Ridge was derived from the uncanny resemblance the early sketches had to a fish's spine.  As the map evolved it took on a more symmetrical layout.  Ridge was added to give an accurate connotation of mountains, as Oksnoop2 wanted to avoid slightly more used terms like "canyon" or "desert."
