## Role ##

|![http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/games/CT/unitpics/bsnipermech.png](http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/games/CT/unitpics/bsnipermech.png)|Long range SM that does heavy damage to units.|
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|

The Saiga Combat Support Mech is in purpose a sniper.  With a long range Sniping Cannon the unit can deliver high damage to enemy units, but it does not fair as well against buildings.  It has a long reload time of 6 seconds to compensate for its power.  If built en masse, they can pose a heavy threat even for a well-balanced and well-used army, but the cost of doing this would very high and leave the player open to early rushing.

## History ##
Like the [Fuma Aerial Combat Mech](http://code.google.com/p/conflictterra/wiki/NKGFumaAerialCombatMech), the Saiga was an early concept that I was eager to realize.  The idea of a sniping mech was born mostly out of the desire for the mechs to be interesting and more than a handful of units with machine guns and missiles.

|An early sketch for the Saiga.|

The design of the unit came very naturally to me, and was a joy to model.  The overall look of the mech drew heavily from the [Metal Gear REX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_REX#Metal_Gear_REX) of [Metal Gear Solid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid).  The angular body, "reverse-joint" legs, and indeed perhaps even the shield-like projections on the sides of the body are all seen on the REX.

|The Metal Gear REX.  It is easy to see the similarities.|

This was the first mech I made that used the "reverse-joint" leg style.  The legs I made used very sharp inward angles for the knees, something I would later step slowly away from.

|Note the sharper angle.|

Below is an example of reverse-joint legs made much later.

|Note the 90 degree angle.|

The shields on the side of the unit were the final touch to the model before I began texturing it.  I felt it was too narrow and boring, and eventually came to this idea of something resembling "radar dampeners."  This however sounded odd and kind of dumb, so I decided they could serve as just extra shielding.

For a long time, the Saiga's weapon actually had an interesting ricochet attribute.  An artifact from when we pillaged Complete Annihilation's scripts for examples and content, the ricochet, or "bounce" added an interesting little feature to the shot.  This was eventually removed when it was deemed unnecessary, and indeed never planned.

## Name ##
The name Saiga is one of the handful of names given specifically to its unit for a reason.  The [Saiga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saika_Ikki), or sometimes Saika, was the name of an army in the Sengoku Jidai of Japan that was famous for extensively using firearms.  [Saiga Magoichi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuki_Magoichi), their leader, is a commonly portrayed figure from historical Japan, and is often a sharpshooter or otherwise just a skilled gunman in a world where the spear and sword are still dominant.  This emphasis on gunnery was of course the reason for giving the name to the "bsnipermech."
