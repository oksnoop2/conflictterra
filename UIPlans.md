# Main Goals #

  * ## Differentiate our game from the other games on the Spring Engine. ##
> Because our game is unrelated to TA and the TA mods in the Spring Engine, we have made it a point early on to try and differentiate ourselves from the norms present in the Spring Engine.  One of the most impressionable ways to help achieve this is to strive for a UI that differs from the default found in Spring Engine, even if it is a small difference.  While we bear no grudge against the default UI, the Development Team feels a more traditional RTS UI could benefit our game.  Examples of the direction we'd like to take:
    * The typical UI for the Age of Empires series of RTS.

    * The UI for a selected building, used to create new units.

    * The UI for a selected military unit, with attack orders.

> It should be noted that the main direction we have for our UI is layout and orientation, not so much the graphical skin.

  * ## Make a more intuitive and helpful UI than the default in the Spring Engine. ##
> The default UI for the Spring Engine certainly covers plenty of bases, and provides players with enough to play game after game, but it is the opinion of the Development Team that certain elements could be more intuitive.  The tooltip in particular could provide more information, stats that are otherwise hidden in the code of the game.

# What We Know #

Nothing.  Pulling around the various aspects of the UI should not be too hard we think, such as putting the minimap elsewhere, but moving more embedded elements of the UI could be tricky.  But we really know nothing about how to do this.

# Potential Problems #

Although we don't know much about how UI are made for the Spring Engine, we imagine that, like most other things, the way the norm or default is is that way for a reason.  It seems that buttons in the UI are just sort of spilled down for however many are present for each unit selected.  Dividing them up into certain areas may not be easy.  Trimming down the buttons for each unit to what is required could help this problem.

# Ideas #

This is a collection of ideas for the actual UI.

  * Flagship Selected.
