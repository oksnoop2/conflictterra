## Role ##

|![http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/games/CT/unitpics/bvhsa.png](http://conflictterra.googlecode.com/svn/games/CT/unitpics/bvhsa.png)|Heavily armored, long range artillery.  Has secondary gun.  Must turn to aim.|
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

The Sekai Type Tank provides the best long-range support in that it boasts the highest combination of raw power and range.  Able to destroy most weaker units in a single hit, and deal devastating damage to buildings, this unit can cause some real panic if used properly.  The negative side of this unit is its extreme lack of speed; it is one of the slowest units for the NKG.  It makes up for this with its beefy amount of HP, and of course, its impressive firepower.  In addition to its main gun, it also has a secondary turret that allows it to deal low damage to nearby units.

The unit must turn itself in order to aim, which makes it best to use while stationary.  In addition, it has the High-Trajectory ability, which allows it to fire over rubble and other obstacles.

## History ##
The Sekai is an odd combination of a unit that I really like the appearance of, despite its poor design which actually limits its functionality.  It wasn't until I got the unit textured and in-game that I finally realized that it did not have the ability to aim on the X axis!  I powered forward anyways, and discovered the whole unit itself could still turn to aim, but this has always been a handicap for this beastly unit.

Its overall appearance came as the result of an errant Google image search, that yielded a very large, heavy, and formidable looking tank.  I instantly liked the look of this tank, and began working on emulating its strengths into my model.

|The T28 "Super Heavy Tank" that the Sekai is based off of.|

This tank I found is called the [T28](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T28_Super_Heavy_Tank), oftentimes nicknamed the "Super Heavy Tank".  What stood out most to me I think was the long, intimidating barrel that protruded not from a turret on top of the vehicle, but from the very front of the body.  I think this really helped convey a sense of power and heaviness, something I too wanted to convey.

I eventually settled on a groove or chasm in the body for the barrel to reside in, indeed the very cause of its aiming handicap.  After a lot of playing with the model, I made the "plating" that sits on the front and top of the unit, that helps the unit come across as heavily armored.

When I went to texture this unit, however, I discovered I had some "bad geometry", which to those not familiar with the world of texturing models, means that part of the model couldn't be textured.  Frustrated, I ended up having to completely remodel the body.

The unit has not seen a ton of use.  It stands as a very powerful unit, but its high cost and slow disposition steers most players away from it.  The naming convention, bvhsa, stands for "very heavy siege artillery", which I felt was too long to cram into a unit name.  It, alongside the blras, are the only two fully abbreviated internal names.

## Name ##
Sekai is the Japanese word for "world", or "earth."  This unit was given the name to help convey its high level of power and force.  The name works well for it, although thinking of it as the "World Tank" can be odd.
